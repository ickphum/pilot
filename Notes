Notes on AWS and React: Creating Full-Stack Apps

Install node & npm via apt.

Had to install npx via "sudo i -g npx"

npm version was too old so installed new version with "sudo npm install npm@latest -g" 
and removed apt version

  850  sudo npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

got some warnings which looked bad re node version but not upgrading til
problems emerge.

  852  amplify configure
  853  amplify init
  854  amplify hosting add
  855  amplify publish

Look up courses on IAM, Cognito identity pools, identity providers, etc

An identity pool has 2 roles (and maybe more?), authed and unauthed; each role has its own permissions.

We're using the user pool identity provider, ie users + passwords. Other providers 
are google, facebook, etc. Identity providers give authenticated users access to the identity pool, which in turn allows permissions based on the role (authed or unauthed).

  858  amplify add auth
  860  amplify push

Check difference between push and publish; push builds local backend resources and provisions to cloud, publish does backend and frontend.
